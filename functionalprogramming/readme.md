# Functional Programming in Python

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. In Python, we can use list comprehensions and set comprehensions as part of the functional programming approach.

List comprehensions are a feature of Python that allows for a concise way to create lists. The syntax is `[expression for item in list]`, where `expression` is any valid expression, `item` is a variable that takes on each value in the `list` one by one, and `list` is the list we are iterating over. In other words, a list comprehension creates a new list by performing an operation on each item in an existing list. Here is an example:

```python
my_list = [item for item in 'hello']
```

Set comprehensions work similarly to list comprehensions, but they produce a set, which is an unordered collection of unique elements. The syntax is `{expression for item in set}`, where `expression` is any valid expression, `item` is a variable that takes on each value in the `set` one by one, and `set` is the set we are iterating over. Like list comprehensions, a set comprehension creates a new set by performing an operation on each item in an existing set. Here is an example:

```python
my_set = {item for item in 'hello'}
