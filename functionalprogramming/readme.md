# Functional Programming in Python

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. In Python, we can use list comprehensions and set comprehensions as part of the functional programming approach.

List comprehensions allow us to create a new list based on an existing list. Here is an example:

```python
my_list = [item for item in 'hello']
```

Set comprehensions, on the other hand, allow us to create a new set based on an existing set. Here is an example:

```python
my_set = {item for item in 'hello'}
```

These are just some of the ways we can use functional programming techniques in Python.
